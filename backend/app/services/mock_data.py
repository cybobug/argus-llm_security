"""
services/mock_data.py — Realistic mock data for all external services.

PURPOSE
-------
The other team modules (attack-engine, digital-twin, chatbot) may not be
running during development.  This file provides realistic stand-in data so
the backend is fully functional on its own.

HOW TO DISABLE MOCKS
--------------------
Set  MOCK_SERVICES=false  in your .env (or docker-compose.yml) and point
the real service URLs:
    ATTACK_ENGINE_URL=http://attack-engine:7002
    DIGITAL_TWIN_URL=http://digital-twin:7001
    CHATBOT_URL=http://chatbot:7003

No code changes needed — just environment variables.
